== Description ==

The People Manager is designed to be a way for people to share quick
data about themselves. Designed and used primarily in a university or
college setting.

This is a beta product and should be used with caution in a production
environment. A list of upcoming features and known bugs can be found
below.

Upcoming Features:

*   "Flexible Types" -- The types are currently limited to Faculty,
Current Student and Alum. We are working on providing a site option that
allows you to maintain these to your specification.

*   "Additional Shortcode Generation Options" -- You'll be able to
specify your own column headers and add/remove columns as you see fit

== Installation ==

1. Upload `people-manager` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Visit the Settings -> Manage People Options to generate a shortcode.
Place this shortcode in a Page and publish it to display data.

4. If desired, you can create a Page and enter the shortcode
`[do_add_person_public_form]` to place a form on your Web site for
people to add themselves to your people directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I have tested the People Manager plugin in version 2.8.4a. No previous
version have been tested, yet. For compatibility with shortcodes, the
lowest WordPress version this plugin is compatible with is 2.5.

* Updated the people manager software so that it will display content 
where the shortcode is placed in the pages, rather than at the top of 
the page.
* Minor bug fixes.
